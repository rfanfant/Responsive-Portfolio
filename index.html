      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p> Graduated from both University of Washington as well as Washington State University with degrees in Material Science and Electrical Engineering. Went to work for Intel Corporation as a semi-conductor engineer. Was immediately introduced to software development, and within 6 months working at Intel I decided to  change my career to software development/engineering.</p>

      <p> Am currently retired after a sucessful career working  as a software development engineer for working for IBM, Intel, Applied Microsystems and Microsoft. Early in my career I focused on embedded software engineering (i.e. developing software/firmware for hardware devices), transitioning to Windows application development as the Windows operating system became popular. My prefered programming languages include C,C++,C# and Phyton. My hobbies include application development (IOT) for the Raspberry Pi,  as well as Ardino family of microcontrollers. Currently am listed as an inventor on 8 patents. </p>
